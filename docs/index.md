</p>


ProjectBuilder helps to speed up the creation and deployment of new applications. It kickstarts new projects based on
templates and app-specific configuration.

Code snippets can be easily transformed into templates and used in future applications. It helps companies to manage
their software stack and minimize maintenance costs.
