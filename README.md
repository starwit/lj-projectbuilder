## Purpose

ProjectBuilder helps to speed up the creation and deployment of new applications. It kickstarts new projects based on templates and app-specific configuration.

Code snippets can be easily transformed into templates and used in future applications. It helps companies to manage their software stack and minimize maintenance costs.
