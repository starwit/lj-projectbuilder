# Architecture

## Abstract
Yet still a lot of boiler plate code needs to be written and creating JEE application quickly remains a challenge. Therefore approach described here shall provide a guide in how to setup an architecture implementing persistence and a RESTful interface layer. To do that properly a (reusable) pattern of inheritance + generic data types is proposed. This (yet unnamed) pattern is applied in persistence, Enterprise Java Beans and in RESTful web service implementation and therefore proved to be quite flexible. If you want to build an web-application, Project Builder provides you a platform to fulfill your ideas. Nevertheless, you have all flexibility to change your application. If you want to have a software which is easy to implement and easy to change, you should use standards. You will find these standards in the lirejarp project template.

The project builder itself is based on the same project structure like the lireparp template. So the following description is valid for both. The project, based on JEE-standards, is build via maven and is parted in subprojects shown in the diagram below. For faster handling, an ant-file is provided. So, assumed ant, maven and JDK 1.8 are installed, you just need to execute ant setup_project on command line to install and start the project. By executing ant info you can find several other parts helping to deal with the project. The project consists of several subprojects depicted in the following diagramms.
Subprojects of lirejarp template

The following subprojects exist in every project built with lirejarp project builder:

### persistence 
This subproject contains classes for database access. Transactions are ensured throught Enterprise Java Beans, if the database supports transactions.

### rest
This subproject enables the access from UI via RESTful webservices.
### webclient
The UI logic is placed in the webclient project. HTML, CSS and Javascript (AngularJS) are used.

### packagewar
The deployment of the project is done via war-file. It contains the projects persistence and rest as jar-files and the webclient. The project packagewar is resonsible for the build.

## Additional projects in lirejarp project builder
In lirejarp project builder, two additional projects are implemented:

### generator
The generator project contains all logik to generate projects configured with the lirejarp project builder.

### dbautoinit
In this project, all database scripts are placed. Throught flyway, these scripts are executed automatically in the DEV-mode. Two databases are supported: h2 and mysql. In system.properties of the tomee-configuration, you can configure, which database is used: flyway.database=h2 lirejarp project puilder with the additional subprojects.

## About implementing data access

You have a group of objects which are different in its structure but should implement the same basic behavior. You have a lots of data objects in your application for whom the standard CRUD-functionality should be provided? For this purpose, an AbstractDao is a common way to handle the implementation of the basic stuff. An AbstractEntity is created as base class for all entities. In the AbstractDao general CRUD functions are implemented using the AbstractEntity. E.g. http://sidaof.sourceforge.net/sidaof/ is a project, which implements an AbstractDao-class. Binding concrete entities to AbstractDao is done via generics.

The architecture presented here goes further and uses this pattern through all layers of the entire architecture: business services (EJBs), RESTful webservices and junit-tests. Data objects extends the class “AbstractEntity”. Each kind of service (EJB, restful webservice, jUnit-testclass) implements the general functionality around the data objects in an abstract class. For each data object and each kind of service concrete service-implementations are added. To prevent class-casts, generics ensure the usage of concrete data object in the abstract part of the implementation.

The following class-diagram provides an overview of the architecture. The description afterwards is given a better understanding of the diagramm.

### Entities for data access
The lirejarp template uses JPA for data access. Hence, database table definitions and validation is defined in the entities.

### Services to deal with entities and save data
With the help of the generic approache, all entities can be saved and deleted using the same functionality. The implementation of the service class contains only specific behavior.

### REST API
RESTful webservices are used as interface between business logic and web UI – a easy and common used way to strictly seperate UI and business logic.

### The Web UI
The User Interface should be changeable easily and without additional deployment. AngularJS is used to enable it.

### Code generation
Code generation via freemarker enables publishing of an entire running application via lirejarp project builder. The intend is to help doing the first step and using a standardized way to implement standard functionality. So, you will just generate once and change the code in the way you want. This pragmatic approach avoids a complex code generation.

## Advantage
You are really fast on creating or extending the backend of small JEE-applications. You avoid to write boiler-plate code because you do not have to implement general functionality in each part of the architecture. You just have to implement additional stuff like special queries. For instance you have an News Entity and you want to diplay all news of the day. Because it is implement only once, all methods doing the same have the same names. Class-casts form abstract to concrete classes are prevented by using Generics.

## Disadvantage
Everywhere abstract classes are used, the risk of deep class hirarchies occures. This can be avoided by using composition or transfer logic in sperate classes.
